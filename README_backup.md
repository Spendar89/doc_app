# DocApp

SCI's web app for designing, managing, and electronically signing documents.

## Installation

### Via Docker

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/) makes installing and maintaining DocApp a breeze, regardless of your operating system.  

*Before you begin, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with Docker and its basic concepts.  Docker’s website offers many great resources, including an interactive [tutorial](https://www.docker.com/tryit/).*

##### Step 1: Install Boot2Docker

The official Docker client for both Windows and Mac is Boot2Docker.  It create Linux virtual machines for running Docker. The following links will walk you through downloading and installing Boot2Docker on your operating system:

[Boot2Docker Installation Guide-Windows](https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/)

[Boot2Docker Installation Guide-Mac](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/)

##### Step 2: Login to Docker

*Note: This assumes you have started a Boot2Docker command-line session.*

Because you’ll be pulling a private Docker image, you need to login to or register for a Docker account:

`$ docker login -e [EMAIL] -p [PASSWORD] -u [USERNAME]`

##### Step 3: Run a Docker Container

Now that you’re logged in, you’re ready to create a container from the Doc App image:

`$ docker run -d -p 3002:3002 --name docapp spendar89/docapp`

This pulls an image from `spendar89/docapp` , uses it to build a container called `docapp`, and starts the application server on port 3002.

*Tip: to confirm that the server is running, you can view the status of your running containers with* `$ docker ps`

Now, in your web browser, visit  http://192.168.59.103:3002/

*Note: 192.168.59.103 is the default ip of Boot2Docker’s VM*

## Configuration



DocApp generates forms using data pulled from a number of configurable sources.  We’ll go over each one.

### HelloSign

##### Templates

HelloSign templates can be created by uploading a PDF form to [HelloSign’s web client](https://www.hellosign.com/home/createTemplate).  There are 4 types of fields that can be layered on top of a form: text, checkbox, date, and signature.  

Signature and date fields are straightforward— they are filled out by the recipient when he or she signs the document.

Text and checkbox fields are a bit more nuanced.  They have 3 variations, determined by the value of the “Who fills this out?” input on the field’s configuration menu:

*Me (now)*: the field is given a static value that appears on all documents generated by the template.

*Client*: the field is treated like a signature or date field and filled out by the recipient when he or she signs the document.

*Me (when sending)*: the field is assigned a label and filled out programatically via the HelloSign API.

Template data is fetched via the HelloSign API and used to determine DocApp form fields.
